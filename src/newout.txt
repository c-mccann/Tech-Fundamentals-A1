It was a bhrigt cold day in April, and the coclks wree skrnitig tehrtien. Witosnn Stmih, 
his cihn nzleuzd into his beasrt in an eforft to epcase the vlie wnid, spplied 
qiklcuy tghoruh the galss doros of Vortciy Mnnasios, touhgh not qilucky egnouh to pveenrt a 
sriwl of gritty dsut from eintrneg aolng wtih him. The hllaawy slmet of bloeid caabbge 
and old rag mats. At one end of it a corleuod petosr, too lgare for 
inodor dsalpiy, had been tkaecd to the wall. It decptied smpily an eruonoms fcae, mroe 
than a mrtee wide: the face of a man of aobut frtoy-five, wtih 
a hevay bclak mcoautshe and rggludey hmsdoane feaetrus. Witsnon made for the sirats. It was 
no use tnryig the lift. Eevn at the bset of teims it was selodm wkinrog, 
and at prnseet the elecrtic crnerut was cut off drunig dyhaiglt hruos. It was part 
of the eocnomy divre in ptiepraoarn for Htae Week. The flat was seevn fihlgts up, 
and Wotnisn, who was trhtiy-nine and had a vasiorce ucler above his rhgit 
aknle, went sollwy, rnetsig sraveel temis on the way. On each lnadnig, oiopspte the lfit
-shfat, the pesotr wtih the emronous face gzaed from the wlal. It was one 
of those purietcs whcih are so ceirtnvod taht the eyes fololw you abuot when you 
mvoe. BIG BEHRTOR IS WATHINCG YOU, the catoipn bateneh it ran.
